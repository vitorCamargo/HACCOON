# HACCOON - Visual Identity

The main objective of this system is to control the company's members, projects and files, as well as internal communication between members and customers. We want to build a web-plataform and a app to facilitate and optimize business processes such as project monitoring, from its creation, requirements gathering, documentation and its implementation.

## ü¶ù Brand Guidelines
The HACCON is more than just a name or just a project. It's a set of values, attributes, and design principles that reflects the spirit of our company. The name mixes the current name of the company 'Haken' that honors a widely used tool in the area of software development: Gitkraken with an acronyms that signify its main goal (Central Control Online). Together, they form the word HACCOON that, cleverly arranged so, sound like 'raccoon', a nocturnal species of animal that has a very well structured and defined internal organization in its nursery, communicates in various forms of sound and be considered one of the smartest and curious animals in nature.

### Color Palette
We will use a color palette known for designs like Threedom Colors, these colors are 3 shades of red, green and blue, also known as RGB. The difference is that with Threedom, the blue becomes the primary color and both red and green become, respectively, secondary and complementary color.

Another point for choosing blue as the main color for the system is that, according to several social researches in the design area showed that blue is the NO.1 color that men and women both like, besides already there are dozens of great applications in the IT area that use blue on their palettes.

By the theory of color design the set of these colors represent: energy, concentration, focus and, mainly, together, guarantee the harmony of colors, bringing the concept of seriousness to the system.
